    <h1><q> WHY TO BYCOTT ISRAELI PRODUCTS </q></h1>
    <P>The boycott of <b>Israeli products</b> is a peaceful protest against the country's violation of <b>Palestinian</b> human rights and ongoing occupation of their land. Boycotting <strong> Israeli products </strong> is a non-violent and effective way to promote <i> justice </i> and <i> peace </i> in the region. </P>
    <P>By boycotting <strong>Israeli products</strong> , we can send a clear message that we do not support Israel's oppressive policies and will not fund them through our purchases.</p>
        
    <p>Israel's occupation has led to countless human rights violations, displacement, and restrictions on basic freedoms. We can also support organizations like <abbr title=Boycott,Divest,Sanctions> BDS </abbr>  and <abbr title=AmnestyInternational> AI </abbr>.  By choosing not to support companies complicit in this oppression, we can make a difference. </p>

    <p>Let us take action and boycott <em> Israeli products </em>, such as <cite>KFC, McDonald's, Nestle, L'OREAL</cite> and much more. Let's stand with <strong> Palestine. </strong></p>
